## Features

- **3D Suspension Geometry** - Visualize suspension layouts including quarter-car, bicycle, and full-car models
- **Adjustable Parameters** - Control spring mass, unsprung mass, spring rate, damping coefficient, and tire stiffness
- **Road Input Simulation** - Apply various inputs (bump, sinusoidal, random) to analyze suspension response
- **Speed Control** - Adjust simulation speed for detailed analysis or fast playback
- **Response Visualization** - Monitor body and wheel displacement, velocity, and acceleration in real-time
- **Interactive 3D View** - Rotate, zoom, and pan the suspension model during simulation
- **Progressive Web App** - Install as PWA for offline use and convenient homescreen access
